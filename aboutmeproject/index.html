    <h2>Vera Antamanova</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Vera. I have recently moved
    to Armenia with my husband and two kids.<br>
    They are 5 and 7 years old.
    We all enjoy living in this place and try to explore it as much as we can.</p>
    <p>I got two bachelor degrees. The first one is in Public Relations and
    the other is in Mediation and Conflict Resolution.<br>
    I received both of them at the Saint Petersburg University</p>
    <p>I have started to learn programming languages about a few years ago.
    I am a bit familiar with Java and Python.<br>
    But I have never been able to get a degree in this field. So, in September 2022
    I have decided to enroll<br>
    to Pathway connect and to start my educational journey through this program.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, especially non-fiction and I probably
    could say thit photography is my hobby.<br>
    I specialize in family and portrait photography. And really enjoy
    meeting new people through this.</p>
    <p>I am really grateful for the opportunity to learn new things with all 
    of you. And I am looking forward to get to know you a little better!</p>
