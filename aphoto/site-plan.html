      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself and share my passion for photography with you.
I'm Vera Antamanova, a professional photographer with 5 years of experience in capturing beautiful moments and telling stories through my lens. Photography has always been my creative outlet, allowing me to freeze fleeting moments in time and preserve memories that will be with people for generations.
My journey as a photographer began when I picked up my first camera, and I instantly fell in love with the power of visual storytelling. Over the years, I have honed my skills, expanded my knowledge, and developed a unique style that blends artistic vision with technical expertise.
I specialize in portrait and family photography. I also have experience with love story and wedding photography. Whether it's capturing the love and emotions of a couple on their wedding day, immortalizing the joy and innocence of families, or creating captivating images for commercial clients, I approach each project with enthusiasm and dedication.
What sets me apart as a photographer is my commitment to establishing a deep connection with my clients. I believe that building a rapport and understanding your vision is crucial in delivering photographs that truly reflect your personality and style. I strive to create a comfortable and enjoyable environment during our sessions, allowing your genuine emotions and true selves to shine through.
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work with a diverse range of clients, each with their unique stories and visions. Collaborating with individuals, families, and businesses has given me invaluable insights into the power of photography in capturing milestones, conveying emotions, and creating impactful visual narratives.
When I'm not behind the camera, you can often find me exploring new locations, immersing myself in nature's beauty, or experimenting with different techniques to push the boundaries of my art. Photography is not just a profession for me; it is an ever-evolving passion that fuels my creativity and drives me to continually seek new ways to capture the world around me.
In my portfolio I present a collection of my finest photographs that reflect my passion, creativity, and dedication as a photographer. Each image tells a unique story and captures moments filled with emotion, beauty, and authenticity.
Here you will find portraits, family photoshoots, love stories and my favorite weddings. I divided it for a few different collections for better navigation. 
If you have any questions, comments, or would like to discuss a photography project, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always excited to collaborate and create meaningful visual experiences.

      <h3>What to Wear</h3>
      <p>
        When preparing for a photoshoot, choosing the right outfit is just as important as finding the perfect location or striking the right pose. Your clothing can significantly impact the overall aesthetic and mood of your photos, as well as reflect your personal style. In this article, we will provide you with essential tips and guidance on what to wear for a photoshoot, helping you look and feel your best in front of the camera.
1. Consider the Purpose and Style of the Photoshoot
The first step in selecting your outfit is to consider the purpose and style of the photoshoot. Are you going for a casual and relaxed look or aiming for a more formal and sophisticated vibe? Think about the overall theme and mood you want to convey through your photographs. For instance, if it's a family photoshoot, you might want to coordinate outfits to create a cohesive and harmonious look. On the other hand, if it's a personal portrait session, you can opt for outfits that showcase your individuality and personal style.
2. Choose Solid Colors and Avoid Busy Patterns
Solid colors are generally a safe choice for photoshoots as they tend to photograph well and draw attention to the subject rather than the clothing itself. Choose colors that complement your skin tone and enhance your features. Neutral tones such as white, black, gray, or beige are versatile and timeless. Bold and vibrant colors can add energy and visual interest to the photos. However, it's generally advisable to avoid wearing clothing with busy patterns, large logos, or distracting graphics, as they can take the focus away from you.
3. Dress for the Location and Season
Consider the location and season when planning your outfit. If you're shooting outdoors, consider the colors and textures of the surroundings. For example, earthy tones and natural fabrics can blend beautifully in a forest or park setting, while bright colors can pop against an urban backdrop. Similarly, choose fabrics and layers appropriate for the weather. Light and breathable fabrics work well for summer shoots, while cozy sweaters and scarves are perfect for autumn or winter sessions. Ensure that your outfit allows you to move comfortably and suits the overall ambiance of the location.
4. Pay Attention to Fit and Flattery 
The fit of your clothing plays a crucial role in how you appear in photos. Choose outfits that fit well and flatter your body type. Avoid clothes that are too tight or too loose, as they can distort your shape. Consider your best features and select outfits that accentuate them. For instance, if you have great legs, opt for a skirt or dress that showcases them. Additionally, pay attention to necklines, sleeve lengths, and waistlines that complement your face shape and body proportions.
5. Accessorize Thoughtfully 
Accessories can add personality and interest to your outfit, but it's important to use them thoughtfully. Choose accessories that enhance your overall look rather than overpower it. Simple jewelry, scarves, hats, or belts can be great options to add visual appeal and individuality. Avoid wearing accessories that may reflect light and distract from your face, such as overly shiny or reflective items.
When it comes to a photoshoot, selecting the right attire is crucial for capturing memorable and flattering images. By considering the purpose and style of the shoot, choosing solid colors, dressing appropriately for the location and season, paying attention to fit and flattery, and accessorizing thoughtfully, you can ensure that your outfit enhances your appearance and conveys the desired mood.
